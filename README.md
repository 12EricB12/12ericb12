## Hello | 你好 👋

I'm Eric, a CS and physics student at McGill University! I hope to pursue a career in computational astronomy sometime in the future.  

Take a look at my projects below for some of the things I've done that I find particularly interesting. You may notice a slight favourability towards computational physics projects... but I really enjoy working on software projects! At the end of the day, I love doing anything that lets me get the satisfaction of solving tough puzzles.

## ✨ Favourite projects...
- [**A Novel Method to Categorize Rogue Planets Through Orbits and N-Body Simulation**](https://github.com/12EricB12/WWSEF-2024)

## 🧪 Some projects I'm currently working on...
- Dark matter map generation using Python
- Websites for clubs
- Portfolio Website

And more! Although they aren't too exciting, so I won't include them here...
